Appendix: How to apply the GPL to your program

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright"
line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. 

   <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
